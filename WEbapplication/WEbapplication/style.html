            <b>Steven Chu</b>(born 1948) is an American physicist and former government official.</br>
            Born in St. Louis into a family with Chinese ancestry, Chu studied at </br>
            the University of Rochester and then earned a PhD in physics at the </br>
            University of California, Berkeley. He became a researcher, first at</br>
            Bell Labs and then later as a professor at Stanford University. </br>
            In 1997 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, along with two </br>
            colleagues, for the "development of methods to cool and trap atoms </br>
            with laser light". In 2009, Chu was appointed United States Secretary </br>
            of Energy in the first administration of president Barack Obama, a <br>
